# Cover Letter  Workshop

##  Introduction

- Composing a cover letter is an integral part of your next journey - beginning the job application process and entering the professional work force.

- It is likely that you will have multiple drafts and versions of cover letters to use for the different types of positions you apply for (Dev vs Solutions, Programmer vs Manager, Front End vs Back End...)

- Luckly, Cover Letters follow a fairly simple pattern. Each one should be around 3 paragraphs - approximately 12-14 sentences, with an introduction and closing. If you can understand the  basic format of a Cover Letter you will see that they are simple to write out for any job you are applying to

### Chat GPT / AI for Cover Letters

- You are not the first person to think "I'll just have AI write this for me". You won't be the last one either.
- Don't do it. People whose jobs it is to read applications can spot an AI written Cover Letter 10 words in. AI simply can not write to the level of ethos, pathos, and gravitas that you will want to have in a strong, professional cover letter.
- If you are not willing to put the effort in to write the 100 or so words that make up a cover letter, interviewers and readers can assume that you will not put the effort in to actually do the work the job entails. Which means you may be starting off the application process on Strike 1. You may think this is a way to save time, it may actually make you look like a weaker candidate.


## Cover Letter Make Up

- A Cover Letter is a lot like a pop song. They all follow a pretty similar structure, they all have the same basic themes, just changing the words. They shouldn't be too long, and shouldn't veer too far outside of their basic format.
  
- As we have said, you may have multiple drafts of your letters saved for you to submit for different jobs. You may need to change up a few of the details, but the format is fairly standard.

- Here is the basic structure of a Cover Letter, which we will break down line by line.

- We can show you this make up, *you'll* need to actually fill in the details!

### Overview 


**Introduction Greeting**
 - "Dear Sir or Madam", "To whom it may concern", "Hello there",
 - This introduction is entirely up to you, and the tone you want to set for the remainder of the letter
 - Don't put *too much* into this, the simpler and more direct this is, the better

**Paragraph 1 - About You**

 - A brief of history about you and what lead you in your career path to this job
 - A bit about your education and work experience (this can be one long sentence, or one sentence for each)
 - Something interesting about yourself that can set you apart from others - volunteer experience, or a personal connection to the role
    
**Paragraph 2 - About the Company**

 - What draws you to this role, and this company (you'll want to do 5 minutes of research to boost this up)
 - How does this company/team relate to your life and why do you want to join them?
 - Use a few words from the posted Job Description here to connect yourself to the role

**Paragraph 3 - Why you'd be a good fit for the role**
 - How do your skills/experiences relate to the role and job
 - How does your ethos relate to that of the company
 - Where do you want to actualize yourself in 5 years, how will your work in this company get you there
 - What can you do to help the company in this time
   
**Paragraph 4 - Closing**
 - "Thank you for reading my application, I can send over any references or letters of recommendation that you would like. I can be reached at *(123)456-7890* or *Your.Email@your.email* for any further questions." is the basic gist of this closing sentence. You can change the wording up as you would like
